## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

R packages - from R shell

	```	
	install.packages("xgboost", dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')
	install.packages("caret", dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')	
	install.packages("docopt", dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')	
	install.packages("protr", dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')
	```


Perl Modules - you may need to add `sudo` before the commands

	```	
	cpan install XML::LibXML	
	cpan install Bio::Tools::Protparam
	cpan install Getopt::Std	
	```

and a modified version of the OB module (used for OB score calculation) that can be downloaded together with TMCrys. It requires the installation of BioPerl (http://bioperl.org/INSTALL.html) for running properly. BioPerl could also be installed during the installation of Bio::Tools::Protparam.
