## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

R packages - from R shell

	```	
	install.packages("xgboost", dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')
	install.packages("caret", dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')	
	install.packages("docopt", dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')

	```


Perl Modules - you may need to add `sudo` before the commands

	```	
	cpan install XML::LibXML	
	cpan install Bio::Tools::Protparam
	cpan install Getopt::Std	
	```

and a modified version of the OB module (used for OB score calculation) that can be downloaded together with TMCrys. It requires the installation of BioPerl (http://bioperl.org/INSTALL.html) for running properly.
